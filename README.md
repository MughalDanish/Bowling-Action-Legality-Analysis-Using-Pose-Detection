## Project Description

Bowling Action Legality Analysis Using Pose Detection is a system designed to analyze and classify the legality of a bowler's action in cricket using advanced pose detection techniques. The system leverages computer vision and machine learning to detect body keypoints, calculate joint angles, and determine whether a bowling action conforms to the legal standards set by cricket authorities.

### Features
- **Pose Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art models to detect and track body keypoints in real-time.
- **Angle Calculation**: Computes joint angles to assess the bowling action.
- **Legality Classification**: Classifies the bowling action as legal or illegal based on calculated angles.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides instantaneous feedback on the legality of the bowling action.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading videos and viewing results.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MughalDanish/Bowling-Action-Legality-Analysis-Using-Pose-Detection.git
    cd Bowling-Action-Legality-Analysis-Using-Pose-Detection
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download Pre-trained Models**:
    - Download the pose detection model from [Mediapipe Models](https://link-to-mediapipe-models.com) and place it in the `models` directory.

## Usage Guide

To analyze a bowling action video, follow these steps:

1. **Run the System**:
    ```bash
    python main.py --video path/to/your/video.mp4
    ```

2. **View Results**:
    - The results will be displayed in the console and saved in the `output` directory.
